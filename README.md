# ungrid [![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/ungrid.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/ungrid)

the simplest responsive css grid



## What's this?

__ungrid__ is a tiny, responsive, table-based CSS grid system. The entire `ungrid.css` file is 97 bytes minified.

```css
@media (min-width: 30em) {
    .row { width: 100%; display: table; table-layout: fixed; }
    .col { display: table-cell; }
}
```

The flex flavored version `ungrid-flex.css` is 71 bytes minified (137 bytes with prefixes, see [Can I Use Flex](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex)) :

```css
@media (min-width: 30em) {
    .row { display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; }
    .col { flex: 1; }
}
```



## Get started

Install with [Bower](http://bower.io) `bower install ungrid` or just copy and paste the contents of ungrid.min.css into your CSS file.



## How to use

To use, simply put as many `.col`s as you wish in your `.row`s and the `.col`s will automatically be evenly spaced. This allows you to roll your own simple grids. [See it in action](http://codepen.io/chrisnager/pen/ypokv) ([flex in action](http://codepen.io/sherbrow/pen/pJRBZx)).

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">⚜</div>
    <div class="col">⚜</div>
    <div class="col">⚜</div>
    …
    <div class="col">⚜</div>
</div>
```
